# TextMiningSocialData

Purpose
This project is designed to enhance my skills in pre-processing and analysing social data.
The tasks involves pre-processing and analysing tweets obtained from three Twitter accounts.
The analysis encompasses scoring tweets for sentiment, constructing a word corpus, generating
a Term Document Matrix, plotting a Word Cloud, and creating an appropriate visual
representation that shows the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative tweets for each Twitter
account.

The objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets from three distinct yet related Twitter
accounts utilizing RStudio.
